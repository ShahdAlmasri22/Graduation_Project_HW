🦱 Hair Transplant Automation System (Graduation Project)
📄 A graduation project that automates hair transplant procedures using smart mechanical design, real-time patient monitoring, and user-friendly integration.
Ensures precise positioning, patient safety, and clean setup with mechanical components, biometric sensors, and visual feedback.

⚙️ Features

🪑 Head Positioning: Automatic alignment on a 42cm aluminum frame for accurate procedures.

💡 Smart Chair: Embedded electronics and sensors for wire-free professional design.

❤️ Vitals Monitoring: MAX30100 (Heart Rate) & MLX90614 (Temperature) with threshold alerts.

🖥️ Dual Displays: OLED for patient, 7” LCD via Raspberry Pi for real-time doctor dashboard.

🔔 Audio Alerts: Triggered only when abnormal readings persist for configurable cycles.

🛠️ Technologies

Microcontrollers: Arduino, ESP8266

Sensors: MAX30100, MLX90614
